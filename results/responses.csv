i often had to compromise;
the program was impressive, i could sense some intelligence;
i felt like the program could cope with my natural use of language, but that it is very bad at understanding my intent. for example, answering ""no"" to a yes/no question was interpreted as a yes;
it felt like each conversation was going through the same questions. a chatbot then seems unnecessary (as a simple web form would be a better way to input the same information, for example);","i think that i want to make the restaurant decision myself, given a list of options;","the computerbrain answered too quickly;
leaving my answer blank broke the conversation;"
