## How run the experiment

To conduct the experiment, run the `experiment.py` file in a terminal.

The program will start by asking for the participant ID. This should be a 3-digit code. The first digit indicates which researcher is conducting the experiment:
1: Luka
2: Jos
3: Andrea
The second two digits indicate which participant is being tested. As a researcher, you should count your participants from 1.

After filling in the id, you can hand the terminal over to the participant.
