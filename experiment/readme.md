## Python installation

The experiment requires python 3 with the following packages:
* numpy
* Levenshtein
* scikit-learn

These can be installed through:

```
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
pip install python-Levenshtein
```

## How run the experiment

To conduct the experiment, run the `experiment.py` file in a terminal.

### Participant ID

The program will start by asking for the participant ID. This should be a 3-digit code. The first digit indicates which researcher is conducting the experiment:
1: Luka
2: Jos
3: Andrea
The second two digits indicate which participant is being tested. Researchers should count their participants from 1.

If you are running this as a researcher, hand the computer over to the participant after filling in the ID. If you are a participant running this on your own compter, ask the researcher what your ID is.
