Implementation of the dialog system in the restaurant recommendation domain: 
modeling of the domain in a dialog model, and implementing and evaluating a machine learning classifier for natural language

Part a: Implementation of a program to process the syntax of the source data, and creating a dialog model based on the dialogs in the dataset.
Part b: Implementation of a machine learning classifier for classifying dialog acts in dialog data.
Part c: Implementation of the dialog state transition diagram that was designed in the first part of the project into a working dialog system.

Used Sklearn's DecisionTreeClassifier() as model.
